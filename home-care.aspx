            <p>There are many different reasons and different times in one's life when a person may need assistance with the daily activities of living. Home care can be care at home to assist someone on the road to recovery after an accident or hospital stay.  Or it can be sustaining and maintaining your loved one’s quality of life at home whether they have Alzheimer’s or dementia or another illness that may limit their ability to care for themselves.</p>

              <p>WFC can help make aging at home possible, by running routine errands, light housekeeping, and providing a helping hand with the everyday tasks that often become more difficult for the elderly. Staying at home does not have to result in isolation and loneliness.  In fact, our eldercare services often bring caring companionship, an opportunity for relationship building and sharing, humor and a sense of purpose back into the lives of our clients.</p>
              <p>Eldercare is provided round-the-clock by regularly scheduled home care aides. We can provide short and long term care for your loved one with regularly scheduled caregivers who are our trained, committed employees. Working together in shifts, we are able to provide a continuous solution for your loved one's safety and security.</p>
              <p>In home care can provide meaningful companionship for people who have limited social engagement due to health problems.</p>
              <p>A need for 24-hour care in the home may last for a few days or for many years. Continuous round-the-clock care can maximize the time that someone has with their family, while also making them comfortable and safe.</p>

              <p class="subHeading yellow">Dementia Care</p>
              <p>When a person lives with dementia, it makes them vulnerable. It is a disease that affects every part of their life – from the moment they wake up in the morning until they get into bed at night. It can leave them feeling disoriented and scared if they wake up after a bad dream. People living with dementia continually deal with anxiety, depression, and often withdraw from the outside world, creating self-imposed isolation.</p>
              <p>Dementia or Alzheimer’s can impact every moment. It can diminish a person’s senses – even changing the tastes and aromas they once enjoyed. Sounds that once brought smiles and comfort evolve into just noise. Even what a person sees gets interpreted differently in the brain. What a person living with dementia or Alzheimer’s used to do easily every day now become insurmountable challenges. Our Alzheimer’s care finds ways to climb those mountains and provide the quality of life that not only are they used to, but that they deserve.</p>
              <p>WFC’s trained caregivers are there help maintain your loved one’s dignity and independence. We feel it’s essential to find ways to ease the emotional frustrations that come with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia-related disorders. These difficulties don’t just affect the person with the condition, but the entire family. Trained caregivers bring families closer together so they all can support the person living with dementia.</p>

            <p>A degenerative disorder can make daily tasks difficult, and personal-care teams can help with what used to be simple such as bathing, getting dressed, and fixing meals – making sure your loved one remains independent as they receive help with their daily activities.</p>

              <p>Most people today have busy and challenging lives. And though they would like to, they cannot always stay home with their sick child, bedridden spouse or recovering father due to important commitments at work. </p>
              <p>Westchester Family Care offers an array of affordable services customized for people of all ages; we care for children, elderly parents, a mentally challenged young adult, or a spouse after surgery. </p>
              <p>The same flexible home care service you’ve grown to trust in elder care is available for people of all ages dealing with any type of health care or life situation.</p>
              <p>Providing relief for you and your family with knowledgeable caregivers is our top priority. The last thing those with a myriad of responsibilities needs is to shoulder a care situation alone, without the support of a caregiving team. Too many of us don’t know where to turn when a loved one needs assistance. We may be unprepared due to a last minute change in condition, or schedule or if the regular care plan falls through.  We are ready when you are in a crunch, with trained caregiver employees who are fully background checked, bonded and insured.  The personalities of the caregiver and the client are a critical component of the match; we go to great lengths to make sure the pairing will succeed.</p>
